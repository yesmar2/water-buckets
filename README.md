## Third Party Libraries
* React Router V6
  * This is the standard library for routing in a single page app in react.

* Styled Components
  * Styling library.  I chose this because it allows for dynamic styling based on props making the bucket animation easier.

## Future Improvments
* Create api for calculating most efficient steps
* Responsive design
* Add more unit and integration tests
* Aliasing for imports
* Better styling for home page and form
